## 🥎 Summary

<img align='center' src="/app/public/img/README.png" alt="Expense Tracker">

Handy little React App to handle and mange your expenses. Featuring a built in chart to showcase your spending month by month across a whole year so you can work out where you can save.

This app is the first of many to come in my journey of learning React and React Hooks - it is simple and helps strengthen fundamentals such as components, nesting, props, useState(). 

Developments to come:
- implementing styled.components
- using local storage to persist data

Project inspiration provided by Maximilian Schwartzmuller <a href="https://academind.com">: Academind</a>
